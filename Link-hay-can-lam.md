# Micro Speech Example
Mục tiêu: build một network cho VĐK 

This examples shows how you can use TensorFlow Lite to run a 20 kilobyte neural network model to recognize keywords in speech. It's designed to run on systems with very small amounts of memory such as microcontrollers and DSPs. The code itself also has a small footprint (for example around 22 kilobytes on a Cortex M3) and only uses about 10 kilobytes of RAM for working memory, so it's able to run on systems like an STM32F103 with only 20 kilobytes of total SRAM and 64 kilobytes of Flash.
