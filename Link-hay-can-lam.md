## Person-Detection-and-Tracking
Introduction
The Project is based on Person Detection and tracking and I am mainly focusing on the Person tracking, if you go through the output gif in the README.md or watch output.mp4 you will be able to see that each person will be provided with an idea as soon as he enters a frame and the number remains with his regardless of the detection happening in concurrent frames. So basically the project focuses on Person Detection and track him as long as he remains in the frame.

## Micro Speech Example
Mục tiêu: build một network cho VĐK 

This examples shows how you can use TensorFlow Lite to run a 20 kilobyte neural network model to recognize keywords in speech. It's designed to run on systems with very small amounts of memory such as microcontrollers and DSPs. The code itself also has a small footprint (for example around 22 kilobytes on a Cortex M3) and only uses about 10 kilobytes of RAM for working memory, so it's able to run on systems like an STM32F103 with only 20 kilobytes of total SRAM and 64 kilobytes of Flash.
